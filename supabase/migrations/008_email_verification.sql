-- 008: email verification HomeSure sends itself.
-- Run AFTER 007. Safe to re-run.
--
-- Why this exists
--   The Supabase auth server is configured with mailer_autoconfirm = false, so it insists on a
--   confirmed email before anyone may sign in — but it has no SMTP configured, so its own
--   confirmation mail fails and signing up dies with "Error sending confirmation email".
--   Changing that is a server setting we do not control.
--
--   So HomeSure sends the mail. /api/auth/signup creates the account UNCONFIRMED through the admin
--   API (which sends nothing and therefore cannot fail), stores a token here, and emails the link
--   itself. /api/auth/verify-email confirms the account when that link is opened.
--
--   The important part: the gate is still the auth server's. An unconfirmed account is refused at
--   sign-in by Supabase itself with "Email not confirmed", not by anything in our code, so it
--   cannot be bypassed by calling the database directly.
