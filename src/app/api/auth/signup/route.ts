 * The Supabase auth server requires a confirmed email before sign-in but has no SMTP, so its own
 * public signup endpoint fails with "Error sending confirmation email". The admin endpoint used
 * here sends nothing, so it cannot fail that way — we create the account UNCONFIRMED and send the
 * mail from this app instead.
 *
 * The account stays unusable until the link is opened. That is enforced by the auth server, not by
 * this code: signing in to an unconfirmed account is refused with "Email not confirmed" no matter
 * who asks.
