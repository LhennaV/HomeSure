//  The hero stays dark on desktop in both themes (only the mobile breakpoint gives it a light
//  version). In light mode that left a white bar sitting on top of a dark panel, which read as two
//  unrelated pieces rather than one page.
//
//  So while the bar overlaps the hero it wears the dark glass, and once you scroll past it the bar
//  goes back to whatever the theme asks for. Pages without a hero are left alone.
//
//  Pure CSS cannot ask "am I currently over that element", which is why this is a few lines of JS
//  rather than another rule in glass-nav.css.
